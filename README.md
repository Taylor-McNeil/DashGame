# Unnamed Dash Game

## About

Growing up in the early 2000's there was a surge of time-management style games. Unforunately this style has fallen out of popularity. This project serves as a tribute to that style. There are several guides and projects about platforms and other styles of games, this project is to serve as an open source template to create a time-management style game.

## Getting Started

Currently the project is still in the build phase and is not ready for testing. The main game loop is still being built out. In the future, the game will be available on itch.io.

## Roadmap

The goal is to get this game on par with traditional time-management style games. There is a long list of features that need to be added. A todo list will be added in the future. <br>
